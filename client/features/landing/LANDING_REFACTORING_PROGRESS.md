# Landing Feature Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This feature is part of a Next.js application built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping

The application follows a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained and follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `data/`: Data fetching and API integration
- `store/`: State management (if needed)

## Current Structure Analysis

The landing feature has a basic structure with components organized in subdirectories (Hero and Button), and empty directories for hooks, types, utils, data, and store. The feature primarily consists of a Hero component that displays a fullscreen landing section with background video, heading text, description, and a call-to-action button, along with a ButtonStart component for the call-to-action.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Directory Structure and Organization

## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1. Complete migration to HeroUI components
2. Optimize Hero component performance
3. Implement proper error handling and loading states
4. Create dedicated types file
5. Add comprehensive tests

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock dependencies and external services
   - Focus on component logic and rendering
2. Integration Tests:
   - Test component interactions
   - Test video loading and error handling
   - Test responsive behavior

## Notes
- Focus on performance optimization for the Hero component
- Ensure proper error handling for video loading
- Prioritize accessibility and responsive design
- Document all components thoroughly
- Follow the established feature-based architecture
