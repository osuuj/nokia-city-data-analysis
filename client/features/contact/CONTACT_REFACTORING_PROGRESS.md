# Contact Feature Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This feature is part of a Next.js application built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping

The application follows a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained and follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `data/`: Data fetching and API integration
- `store/`: State management (if needed)

## Current Structure Analysis

The contact feature has a well-structured implementation with form handling, validation, and UI components. The feature uses HeroUI for the interface and implements proper form state management with TypeScript support.

### Key Components:
- ContactForm: A reusable form component with validation and error handling
- ContactPage: A page component that integrates the form with a layout

### Data Management:
- Uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implements form state management with TypeScript
- Provides validation and error handling

## In Progress Tasks ðŸš§

### UI Component Migration
- [ ] Migrate from Chakra UI to HeroUI
  - [ ] Update ContactForm component
  - [ ] Update ContactPage component
  - [ ] Ensure responsive design works correctly
  - [ ] Test dark mode support

### API and Data Fetching
- [ ] Implement contact API client
  - [ ] Add proper error handling
  - [ ] Add retry logic
  - [ ] Add timeout handling

### Error Handling and Loading States
- [ ] Implement ContactErrorBoundary component
- [ ] Add ContactFormSkeleton component
- [ ] Add error message components
- [ ] Add loading spinner component

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Optimize component re-renders
  - [ ] Add React.memo to components that don't need frequent updates
  - [ ] Implement useMemoizedCallback for event handlers
  - [ ] Optimize dependency arrays in useEffect and useMemo hooks
- [ ] Implement form validation optimizations
  - [ ] Use debounced validation for real-time feedback
  - [ ] Optimize validation rules

## Upcoming Tasks ðŸ“‹

### Testing Implementation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Add unit tests for components
  - [ ] Add tests for useContactForm hook
  - [ ] Add tests for validation logic
- [ ] Add test utilities and helpers
  - [ ] Create mock data for testing
  - [ ] Add custom test renderers

### Documentation Enhancement
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- [ ] Create component documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Document state management patterns

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Improve accessibility
  - [ ] Add ARIA labels
  - [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
  - [ ] Add screen reader support
- [ ] Add form field focus states
- [ ] Add form submission feedback animations

## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1. Complete migration to HeroUI components
2. Implement contact API client
3. Add error handling and loading states
4. Add accessibility improvements
5. Create test suite

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock dependencies and external services
   - Focus on component logic and rendering
2. Integration Tests:
   - Test form validation
   - Test form submission
   - Test error handling
   - Test success scenarios

## Notes
- Need to implement actual API integration
- Focus on improving accessibility
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Consider adding form analytics
- Document API integration requirements
- Ensure responsive design works across all devices
- Follow the established feature-based architecture
