# Nokia City Data Analysis - Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Nokia City Data Analysis project, based on the actual code structure and implementation.

## Documentation Structure

- [Features](./features/README.md) - Documentation for each feature in the application
- [Shared Components](./shared/README.md) - Documentation for shared components, hooks, and utilities

## Project Overview

The Nokia City Data Analysis project provides visualization and analysis tools for city-related data. The application is built with:

- Next.js (React framework)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Various data visualization libraries

## Project Architecture

The application follows a feature-based architecture:

```
client/
├── features/            # Feature modules
│   ├── about/           # About pages feature
│   ├── contact/         # Contact feature
│   ├── dashboard/       # Main dashboard feature
│   ├── landing/         # Landing page feature
│   ├── project/         # Project details feature
│   └── resources/       # Resources feature
├── shared/              # Shared components and utilities
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   ├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   └── ...              # Other shared code
└── app/                 # Next.js app directory
```

## Best Practices

1. **Component Reuse** - Use shared components whenever possible
2. **Feature Organization** - Keep feature-specific code within its feature directory
3. **Documentation** - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
4. **Types** - Use TypeScript types consistently for better type safety

## Contributing

When working with this codebase:

1. Follow the established code organization patterns
2. Document any new components or significant changes
3. Use the shared components and utilities
4. Follow TypeScript best practices
