# About Feature Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This feature is part of a Next.js application built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping

The application follows a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained and follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `data/`: Data fetching and API integration
- `store/`: State management (if needed)

## Current Structure Analysis

The about feature has a well-organized structure with separate directories for components, hooks, types, utils, data, and store. The feature primarily displays team member profiles with sections for skills, projects, experience, and education.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Directory Structure and Organization
- [x] Created appropriate subdirectories (components, hooks, types, utils, data, store)
- [x] Created barrel files for exports
- [x] Set up proper import paths
- [x] Implemented feature-specific error boundary

### Type System and Data Layer
- [x] Created dedicated types file
- [x] Defined TeamMemberProfile interface
- [x] Set up proper data structure for team member profiles

### API and Data Fetching
- [x] Implemented useProfileData hook with React Query
- [x] Added proper error handling
- [x] Set up caching with staleTime and gcTime

### Error Handling and Loading States
- [x] Implemented AboutErrorBoundary component
- [x] Added ProfileSkeleton component for loading states
- [x] Added error handling in ProfilePage component

## In Progress Tasks ðŸš§

### UI Component Migration
- [ ] Migrate from Chakra UI to HeroUI
  - [ ] Update ProfilePage component
  - [ ] Update ProfileCard component
  - [ ] Update SkillsSection component
  - [ ] Update ExperienceSection component
  - [ ] Update EducationSection component
  - [ ] Ensure responsive design works correctly
  - [ ] Test dark mode support

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Optimize component re-renders
  - [ ] Add React.memo to components that don't need frequent updates
  - [ ] Implement useMemoizedCallback for event handlers
  - [ ] Optimize dependency arrays in useEffect and useMemo hooks
- [ ] Implement code splitting for large components
  - [ ] Split ProfilePage into smaller components
  - [ ] Add lazy loading for sections

### Testing Implementation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Add unit tests for components
  - [ ] Add tests for useProfileData hook
  - [ ] Add tests for data transformations
- [ ] Add test utilities and helpers
  - [ ] Create mock data for testing
  - [ ] Add custom test renderers

### Code Quality and Linting
- [ ] Add proper JSDoc documentation to all components and hooks
- [ ] Ensure consistent code style across the feature
- [ ] Fix any TypeScript errors

## Upcoming Tasks ðŸ“‹

### Documentation Enhancement
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- [ ] Create component documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Document state management patterns

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Improve accessibility
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation
- [ ] Implement responsive design improvements

## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1. Complete migration to HeroUI components
2. Optimize component re-renders
3. Implement code splitting
4. Add comprehensive tests

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock dependencies and external services
   - Focus on component logic and rendering
2. Integration Tests:
   - Test component interactions
   - Test data flow between components
   - Test feature-level functionality

## Notes
- Focus on performance optimization
- Maintain consistent code style
- Prioritize type safety and error handling
- Document all major changes
- Follow the established feature-based architecture
