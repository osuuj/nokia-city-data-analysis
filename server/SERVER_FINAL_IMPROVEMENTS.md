By thoroughly testing across environments, we ensure that the improvements maintain compatibility while delivering better reliability, security, and performance.

## 10. Code Cleanup & Optimization

This is a new section added after analyzing the codebase file by file:

### Duplicate Code & Functionality

- âœ… **Duplicate Analytics Logic**: There's duplicate logic between the analytics router and service:
  - âœ… Removed duplicated helper functions from the router
  - âœ… Imported constants from the service layer instead
  - âœ… Created consistent interface between router and service

- ðŸ”„ **Legacy Raw SQL Implementation**: The raw SQL implementation is kept for comparison but is no longer needed:
  - `get_business_data_by_city_raw_sql` function could be removed after confirming the SQLAlchemy version works correctly
  - Or rename to indicate it's only for benchmarking/testing purposes

### Model Improvements

- âœ… **Incomplete ORM Models**: Several models were missing required fields:
  - âœ… Added missing fields to the Website model
  - âœ… Completed CompanyForm and CompanySituation models
  - âœ… Added proper foreign key relationships

- ðŸ”„ **Schema Consistency**: Ensure consistency between Pydantic schemas and SQLAlchemy models:
  - Some models have different field names than their corresponding schemas
  - Action: Audit models and schemas to ensure naming consistency

### Health Check Endpoints

- âœ… **Duplicate Health Endpoints**: There were two sets of health check endpoints:
  - âœ… Consolidated by redirecting `/health` to `/api/health`
  - âœ… Enhanced health check response with version and environment
  - âœ… Added better documentation and return type hints

### Configuration Management

- âœ… **Multiple Configuration Sources**: Configuration settings were spread across files:
  - âœ… Centralized analytics constants in config.py
  - âœ… Added rate limit settings to config.py
  - âœ… Added cache TTL settings to config.py
  - âœ… Updated all modules to use centralized settings

### Comments & Documentation

- âœ… **Outdated Comments**: Some comments were outdated or unnecessary:
  - âœ… Removed commented-out code like `# create_db_and_tables()`
  - âœ… Removed unnecessary markers like `# âœ… Initialize FastAPI application`
  - âœ… Updated comments to be more informative

### Testing Improvements

- âœ… **Test Coverage for Edge Cases**: Added tests for edge cases and error handling:
  - âœ… Added tests for handling of empty or malformed input
  - âœ… Added tests for caching behavior
  - âœ… Added tests for API error handling
  - âœ… Added tests for parameter validation
