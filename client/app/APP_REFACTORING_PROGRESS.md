# Application Refactoring Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of refactoring the application to improve code organization, maintainability, and performance.

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This application is built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping
- **Redis**: For server-side caching

The application follows a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained and follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `data/`: Data fetching and API integration
- `store/`: State management (if needed)
