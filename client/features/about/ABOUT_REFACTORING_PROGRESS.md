# About Feature Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack & Architecture
- React 18 with TypeScript
- HeroUI for UI components
- Framer Motion for animations
- Zod for schema validation
- React Query for data fetching
- React Router for navigation
- React Error Boundary for error handling
- React Suspense for code splitting

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Enhanced type system with comprehensive interfaces for all components
- [x] Added Zod schemas for profile data validation
- [x] Migrated UI components to HeroUI:
  - [x] ProfilePage
  - [x] ProfileHeader
  - [x] SkillsSection
  - [x] ProjectsSection
  - [x] ExperienceSection
  - [x] EducationSection
- [x] Implemented performance optimizations:
  - [x] Component memoization
  - [x] Progressive loading strategy with React Suspense
  - [x] Optimized animations with Framer Motion
  - [x] Staggered animations for better UX
- [x] Updated mock data to match new schema structure
- [x] Added proper error handling with Error Boundaries
- [x] Implemented loading states with skeletons
- [x] Added comprehensive component API documentation

## In Progress
- [ ] Implementing comprehensive testing suite:
  - [ ] Unit tests for components
  - [ ] Integration tests for data flow
  - [ ] E2E tests for critical user paths
- [ ] Adding documentation:
  - [x] Component API documentation
  - [ ] Usage examples
  - [ ] Performance optimization guide

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing implementation
2. Add remaining documentation
3. Perform performance audits
4. Implement accessibility improvements
5. Add analytics tracking

## Notes
- All UI components have been successfully migrated to HeroUI
- Performance optimizations are in place with lazy loading and animations
- Data validation is now handled through Zod schemas
- Mock data structure matches the new schema definitions
- Component documentation is complete and available in the docs/components directory
