# Project Feature Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This feature is part of a Next.js application built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping
- **Zod**: For runtime type validation
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions

The application follows a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained and follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
  - `ui/`: Reusable UI components
  - `hero/`: Hero section components
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `data/`: Data fetching and API integration
- `store/`: State management (if needed)
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `docs/`: Documentation files

## Current Structure Analysis

The project feature has a comprehensive structure with well-organized components and utilities. The feature includes multiple components for displaying project details, including ProjectCard, ProjectDetailClient, TechStackShowcase, TimelineSection, and GalleryViewer. It also has a sophisticated caching system implemented with React Query and dedicated configuration.

### Key Components:
- ProjectDetailClient: Main component for project details
- ProjectCard: Card component for project summaries
- UI Components (in ui/ directory):
  - TechStackShowcase: Displays project tech stack
  - TimelineSection: Shows project timeline
  - GalleryViewer: Handles project gallery
  - ProjectSkeleton: Loading state for projects
  - ProjectErrorBoundary: Error handling for project components
- AnimatedProjectHero: Hero section for projects

### Data Management:
- Uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Has optimized cache configuration
- Implements prefetching and invalidation strategies
- Uses Zod for runtime type validation
