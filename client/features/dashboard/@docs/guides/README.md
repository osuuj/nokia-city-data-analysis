## Getting Started

To get started with the Dashboard feature, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Development Environment**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Understand the Feature-Based Architecture**

   The Dashboard feature follows a feature-based architecture. Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities. See [ADR-001: Feature-Based Architecture](./ADRs/001-feature-based-architecture.md) for more details.

   The Dashboard feature interacts with several backend services to fetch and process data for analytics, filtering, and visualization. See [API Documentation](./API.md) for more details.

4. **Understand Error Handling**

   The Dashboard feature implements a comprehensive error handling strategy. See [ADR-002: Error Handling Strategy](./ADRs/002-error-handling-strategy.md) for more details.

5. **Understand Data Fetching**

   The Dashboard feature implements a comprehensive data fetching strategy using React Query. See [ADR-003: Data Fetching Strategy](./ADRs/003-data-fetching-strategy.md) for more details.
