# App Folder Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This application is built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping

The application follows a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained and follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `data/`: Data fetching and API integration
- `store/`: State management (if needed)

## Current Structure Analysis

The app folder contains Next.js pages and API routes. Currently, there's a mix of approaches:
- Some pages directly import components from the features directory
- Some pages have their own components
- API routes are organized by resource type
- Some pages lack proper error boundaries and loading states

### Key Pages:
- Home page (`page.tsx`)
- Project pages (`project/page.tsx`, `project/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Contact page (`contact/page.tsx`)
- Dashboard page (`dashboard/page.tsx`)
- About page (`about/page.tsx`)
- Resources page (`resources/page.tsx`)

### API Routes:
- Avatar API (`api/avatar/`)
- Cities API (`api/cities/`)
- Analytics API (`api/analytics/`)
- Companies API (`api/companies/`)

## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1. Refactor pages to use feature components
2. Add proper error boundaries and loading states
3. Improve page metadata
4. Add proper TypeScript types
5. Refactor API routes
6. Add API route tests
7. Optimize page loading
8. Optimize API routes
9. Add JSDoc comments to pages and API routes
10. Create page documentation
11. Improve accessibility
12. Add page transitions
13. Create comprehensive test suite

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test individual pages in isolation
   - Mock dependencies and external services
   - Focus on page logic and rendering
   - Test error handling
2. Integration Tests:
   - Test page navigation
   - Test API integration
   - Test error handling
   - Test success scenarios
3. Accessibility Tests:
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Test screen reader compatibility
   - Test ARIA attributes
   - Test focus management

## Notes
- Need to align app folder structure with feature-based architecture
- Focus on improving accessibility
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Consider adding page analytics
- Document API routes
- Ensure responsive design works across all devices
- Follow the established feature-based architecture
- Consider adding page transitions
- Consider adding loading animations
- Consider adding error animations
- Consider adding success animations
