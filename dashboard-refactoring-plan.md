# Dashboard Feature Refactoring Plan

## Current Understanding of Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is a complex feature with multiple views and shared components:

- **Layout Components**:
  - Sidebar (navigation and filters)
  - Header (with view switcher buttons, theme toggle, GitHub link)
  - Footer

- **Views**:
  - Table View (data table with toolbar)
  - Map View (geographic visualization)
  - Split View (combined map and table)
  - Analytics View (multiple cards and charts)

- **Shared Components**:
  - City search/autocomplete (used across views)
  - Loading states
  - Error handling
  - Common UI elements

## Current Structure Issues

1. **Scattered Components**: Analytics components are spread across multiple directories (`analytics-cards`, `analytics-charts`, etc.)
2. **Duplicated Functionality**: City search appears in multiple views but isn't extracted to a reusable component
3. **Large Components**: `DashboardPage.tsx` (11KB) handles too many responsibilities
4. **Unclear Boundaries**: Between shared components and feature-specific components
5. **Multiple Error Handling Approaches**: Several error components with overlapping functionality
6. **Deprecated Components**: Still maintained in the codebase
7. **Legacy Directories**: Some old directories (`analytics-comparison`, `analytics-selection`, etc.) remain despite the new structure

## New Proposed Structure

## Progress Summary (Updated July 2025)

The dashboard refactoring has made significant progress, with structural alignment now complete:

1. **Completed Items**:
   - Created feature-based organization with proper directory structure
   - Implemented view-based component architecture (TableView, MapView, AnalyticsView)
   - Extracted CitySearch component with custom hook for reusability
   - Improved data fetching with dedicated hooks
   - Consolidated error handling patterns
   - Removed all legacy directories and components
   - Refactored DashboardPage.tsx to use custom hooks for state management and loading logic
   - Organized components into proper directories (layout, common, views, controls)
   - Moved all shared components to the common directory
   - Standardized component location and naming
   - Created barrel export files for improved importing

2. **Current Status**:
   - The code structure now follows the view-based organization principle 
   - All legacy directories have been removed
   - Components are organized according to their functionality
   - Error handling is consolidated in the common/error directory
   - Some import paths still need to be updated throughout the codebase
   - Barrel exports have been created to simplify imports

3. **Immediate Tasks**:
   - Continue fixing broken imports throughout the project
   - Test the application to ensure refactoring didn't break functionality
   - Complete the remaining import updates

4. **Technical Debt Addressed**:
   - Eliminated duplicated code across components
   - Removed redundant directories and components
   - Improved component organization and discoverability
   - Enhanced type safety and error handling
   - Simplified imports with barrel files

The major structural changes are now complete, and we're making good progress on updating import paths. We've fixed the critical build errors by updating imports in key files. Our next focus is on completing the remaining import updates and testing to ensure everything works correctly.
