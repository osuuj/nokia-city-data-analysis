# Shared Resources Refactoring Progress

## Current Structure Analysis

The `client/shared` folder contains various resources that are used across the application. The current structure is as follows:

```
client/shared/
├── components/         # Shared UI components
│   ├── data/          # Data-related components
│   ├── error/         # Error-related components
│   ├── loading/       # Loading-related components
│   ├── ui/            # UI components
│   ├── layout/        # Layout components
│   ├── README.md      # Documentation for components
│   └── index.ts       # Export file
├── hooks/             # Shared hooks
│   ├── useEnhancedQuery.ts
│   ├── useApi.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── context/           # Shared context providers
│   ├── LoadingContext.tsx
│   ├── BreadcrumbContext.tsx
│   └── index.ts
├── utils/             # Utility functions
│   └── cn.ts
├── api/               # API-related utilities
│   ├── client.ts
│   ├── types.ts
│   ├── endpoints.ts
│   ├── errors.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── styles/            # Global styles
│   ├── global-additions.css
│   ├── globals.css
│   └── index.ts
├── providers/         # Application providers
│   ├── Providers.tsx
│   └── index.ts
└── types/             # Shared type definitions
    └── index.ts
```

## Proposed Structure

To better organize the shared resources, we propose the following structure:

```
client/shared/
├── components/         # Shared UI components
│   ├── data/          # Data-related components
│   ├── error/         # Error-related components
│   ├── loading/       # Loading-related components
│   ├── ui/            # UI components
│   ├── layout/        # Layout components
│   ├── README.md      # Documentation for components
│   └── index.ts       # Export file
├── hooks/             # Shared hooks
│   ├── data/          # Data-related hooks
│   │   ├── useEnhancedQuery.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── api/           # API-related hooks
│   │   ├── useApi.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── index.ts       # Main export file
├── context/           # Shared context providers
│   ├── loading/       # Loading-related context
│   │   ├── LoadingContext.tsx
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── breadcrumb/    # Breadcrumb-related context
│   │   ├── BreadcrumbContext.tsx
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── index.ts       # Main export file
├── utils/             # Utility functions
│   ├── cn.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── api/               # API-related utilities
│   ├── client.ts
│   ├── types.ts
│   ├── endpoints.ts
│   ├── errors.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── styles/            # Global styles
│   ├── global-additions.css
│   ├── globals.css
│   └── index.ts
├── providers/         # Application providers
│   ├── Providers.tsx
│   └── index.ts
├── types/             # Shared type definitions
│   └── index.ts
└── README.md          # Documentation for shared resources
```

## Refactoring Steps

1. **Create New Directory Structure**
   - Create new directories for hooks, context, and other resources
   - Move files to their respective directories
   - Update import paths in all files

2. **Update Export Files**
   - Create index.ts files in each directory
   - Update main index.ts files to export from new directories

3. **Update Import Paths**
   - Update import paths in all files that use shared resources
   - Ensure all imports are using the new directory structure

4. **Documentation**
   - Create a README.md file for the shared resources
   - Update existing documentation to reflect the new structure

5. **Testing**
   - Test all components and hooks to ensure they work with the new structure
   - Fix any issues that arise during testing

### Next Steps 🚀
1. **Continue Testing and Validation**
   - [ ] Complete testing of useMemoizedCallback hook
   - [ ] Test usePagination hook
   - [ ] Test API-related hooks
   - [ ] Test context providers
   - [ ] Test API client functionality
   - [ ] Perform integration testing between hooks, context, and components

2. **Final Validation**
   - [ ] Run end-to-end tests of the application
   - [ ] Verify all features work with the new structure
   - [ ] Document any remaining issues or improvements

### Known Issues 🐛
- None reported yet - will be updated as refactoring progresses

### Notes
- The refactoring process should be done incrementally to minimize disruption
- Each step should be tested before moving to the next
- All changes should be documented in this file
- When moving files, ensure to update all import paths across the application
- Consider adding unit tests for utilities and hooks during reorganization

### Next Actions (Immediate) 🎯
1. Complete testing of useMemoizedCallback hook
2. Move on to testing usePagination hook
3. Test API-related hooks
4. Test context providers
5. Document test results in TESTING_SUMMARY.md
