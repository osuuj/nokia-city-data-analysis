   - âœ… Moved components to appropriate locations based on their functionality
   - âœ… Created barrel files for component exports
   - âœ… Extracted common components like CitySearch to reusable modules

2. **Bridge File Strategy**
   - âœ… Created bridge files for backward compatibility during refactoring
   - âœ… Added documentation to all bridge files explaining their purpose and deprecation timeline
   - âœ… Created a clear migration path for dependent code
   - âœ… Added JSDoc @deprecated annotations to bridge files
   - âœ… Updated bridge files with enhanced deprecation notices
   - âœ… Performed impact analysis to verify that no components are still importing from bridge files

3. **Component Enhancement**
   - âœ… Enhanced the CitySearch component with better accessibility features
   - âœ… Added ARIA attributes and screen reader support
   - âœ… Improved keyboard navigation for the Autocomplete component
   - âœ… Started applying memoization to optimize render performance

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - âœ… Applied React.memo to key components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - âœ… Added useMemo for expensive calculations and JSX trees
   - âœ… Used proper dependency arrays for memoized values

5. **Hooks Implementation**
   - âœ… Created dedicated useAnalyticsData hook for centralized analytics state management
   - âœ… Enhanced useMapData hook with additional functionality
   - âœ… Enhanced useTableData hook with advanced features and error handling
   - âœ… Added proper error handling and safety checks
   - âœ… Improved type safety for all hooks

6. **Documentation**
   - âœ… Created comprehensive documentation for custom hooks
   - âœ… Added component documentation for MapView
   - âœ… Documented optimization patterns and best practices
   - âœ… Updated bridge file removal strategy with detailed steps and fallback plans

7. **Import Path Updates**
   - âœ… Updated imports in dashboard page and layout files
   - âœ… Updated relative imports within the dashboard feature
   - âœ… Replaced obsolete path references with modern structure
   - âœ… Verified that no components are importing from bridge files

## In Progress Tasks

1. **Analytics View Optimization**
   - âœ… Fixed type issues in the AnalyticsView cards
   - âœ… Improved component props and type safety
   - ðŸ”„ Continuing to optimize analytics components and charts

2. **Table Data Management**
   - âœ… Enhanced useTableData hook with advanced features:
      - URL parameter state persistence
      - Advanced filtering capabilities
      - Row selection management
      - Data export functionality
      - Error handling with fallbacks
   - ðŸ”„ Updating TableView component to leverage the enhanced hook

3. **Bridge File Removal**
   - âœ… Added enhanced deprecation notices to all bridge files
   - âœ… Performed impact analysis to find any remaining dependencies
   - âœ… Attempted testing removal of the AnalyticsView bridge file
   - ðŸ”„ Working to fix unrelated TypeScript errors before completing bridge file removal
   - ðŸ”„ Planning for gradual removal once build issues are fixed

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Bridge File Removal**
   - Fix any TypeScript errors that prevent a successful build
   - Safely remove bridge files one by one following the documented strategy
   - Test thoroughly after each bridge file removal
   - Update documentation to reflect the changes

2. **Complete Component Optimization**
   - Address remaining prop validation in view components
   - Optimize the TableView component with proper memoization
   - Audit all components for performance bottlenecks
   - Add comprehensive error boundaries

3. **CitySearch Component Enhancement**
   - Add more robust keyboard navigation features
   - Improve error handling and validation
   - Add proper focus management
   - Ensure complete accessibility compliance

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Eliminated duplicated components and functionality
- Improved organization and maintainability of the codebase
- Enhanced type safety and eliminated type errors
- Improved accessibility for users with disabilities
- Applied performance optimizations to reduce unnecessary rerenders
- Centralized data management through custom hooks
- Added proper error handling and safety checks
- Implemented URL state persistence for sharable views
- Fixed import paths to use modern structure
- Prepared bridge files for removal with clear deprecation notices

## Next Immediate Actions

1. âœ… ~Fix the type errors in the AnalyticsView cards~
2. âœ… ~Enhance the useMapData hook with additional functionality~
3. âœ… ~Create dedicated TableView hook with advanced features~
4. âœ… ~Update import paths to use the new structure~
5. âœ… ~Update the TableView component to leverage the enhanced hook~
6. âœ… ~Begin implementing bridge file removal strategy~
7. Fix TypeScript errors preventing successful build
8. Complete bridge file removal according to the documented strategy
