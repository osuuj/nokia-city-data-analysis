# Entity Configurations
#
# This file defines the entities processed in the ETL pipeline. Each entity 
# represents a table or dataset to be extracted, transformed, and loaded. 
# For each entity, it specifies the name, corresponding database table, 
# and the extractor function to be used.
#
# Key Sections:
# - `entities`: Lists all the entities with their metadata, including:
#   - `name`: The name of the entity.
#   - `table`: The target database table.
#   - `extractor`: The function used to process the entity.
