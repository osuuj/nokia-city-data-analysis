# Server Deployment Checklist

## AWS Cloud Deployment

- [ ] Deploy to AWS ECS using the task definition in `deployment/aws-ecs-task-definition.json`
- [ ] Verify all endpoints work correctly in the cloud environment
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch metrics and logging
- [ ] Configure proper security groups and VPC settings for database access
- [ ] Set up environment variables in ECS task definition

## Client Integration

- [ ] Verify the client-side API integration in the client folder works with the deployed API
- [ ] Test CORS configuration with the Vercel frontend
- [ ] Update the API base URL in the Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Test authentication flow (if applicable)

## End-to-End Validation

- [ ] Create automated integration tests for the entire flow
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for testing both client and server together
- [ ] Establish monitoring for key API endpoints
- [ ] Set up alerts for API failures or performance issues
- [ ] Document API contracts for frontend developers

## Final Documentation

- [ ] Update the API documentation with production endpoints
- [ ] Create user documentation for using the API
- [ ] Document deployment process for future team members
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Security Audit

- [ ] Conduct a security audit of the deployed application
- [ ] Verify proper rate limiting is in place and working
- [ ] Check that all secrets are properly managed and not exposed
- [ ] Ensure database credentials are securely stored

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Conduct load testing on key endpoints
- [ ] Verify database indexes are working efficiently
- [ ] Check cache effectiveness for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize slow queries if identified

## Future Improvements

These items from the SERVER_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md are deferred for future implementation:

- [ ] JWT authentication and RBAC - when user management becomes necessary
- [ ] Client SDK generation - if frontend needs tighter API integration
- [ ] X-Ray integration for better observability in production
