# Architecture Decisions

This file documents important architectural decisions for the Shared module, their context, and consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. It provides a record of what was decided, why it was decided, and what the consequences of the decision are.

## ADR Template

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# ADR [number]: [title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[Description of the context and problem statement]

## Decision

[Description of the decision made]

## Consequences

### Positive

[List of positive consequences]

### Negative

[List of negative consequences]

## Implementation

[Description of how the decision will be implemented]

## Alternatives Considered

[Description of alternatives that were considered and why they were rejected]
```

## Current Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: Centralized Documentation Structure

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Documentation was scattered across multiple README.md files in different directories, making it difficult to maintain and navigate.

**Decision**: Create a centralized `@docs` directory with clearly named documentation files for each major part of the shared module.

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Documentation is easier to find, maintain, and update.
- **Positive**: Consistent structure across all documentation files.
- **Negative**: Requires updating links that point to the old documentation structure.

**Implementation**: Move all documentation to the `@docs` directory and update links in the main README.md file.

### ADR-002: Component Directory Structure

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Components were scattered across multiple directories with inconsistent naming conventions.

**Decision**: Organize components by their functional category (ui, layout, data, error, loading, etc.).

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Easier to find components by their purpose.
- **Positive**: Consistent import patterns.
- **Negative**: Requires updating imports in existing code.

**Implementation**: Reorganize components into functional categories and create index.ts files for clean exports.

## Adding New Architecture Decisions

1. Create a section in this file with the ADR number and title.
2. Follow the template structure.
3. Document the context, decision, and consequences.
4. Add implementation details and alternatives considered.
