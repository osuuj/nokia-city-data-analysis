# Contact Feature Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This feature is part of a Next.js application built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping

The application follows a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained and follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `data/`: Data fetching and API integration
- `store/`: State management (if needed)

## Current Structure Analysis

The contact feature has a well-structured implementation with form handling, validation, and UI components. The feature uses HeroUI for the interface and implements proper form state management with TypeScript support.

### Key Components:
- ContactForm: A reusable form component with validation and error handling
- ContactPage: A page component that integrates the form with a layout
- ContactFormSkeleton: A loading skeleton component for the contact form
- ContactErrorBoundary: An error boundary component for handling errors

### Data Management:
- Uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implements form state management with TypeScript
- Provides validation and error handling
- Includes a robust API client with retry logic and caching
