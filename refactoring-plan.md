- [ ] Update any references to old component structures in the app routes

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Test pages to ensure they render correctly
- [ ] Fix any styling or layout issues
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works properly

- [ ] Implement internationalization support

## Benefits of Completed Refactoring
- ✅ Better separation of data and UI
- ✅ More modular component structure
- ✅ Each profile maintains its own identity (fixed name swap)
- ✅ Easier to add new team members in the future
- ✅ More maintainable codebase
- ✅ Component-based approach improves reusability
- ✅ Reduced file size: eliminated 1834 lines of legacy code
- ✅ Cleaner directory structure with removal of unused files and directories
- ✅ Improved data consistency by standardizing on teamMembers data source

## Latest Data Cleanup

We've continued to refine the codebase with additional data cleanup:

- [x] Deleted `client/features/about/data/mockData.ts` - Removed unused mock data
- [x] Simplified `client/features/about/data/aboutContent.ts` - Removed redundant profile data that's now in dedicated files
- [x] Updated `client/features/about/data/index.ts` - Fixed export references to deleted files
- [x] Standardized on dedicated data files (`teamMembers.ts`, `juusoData.ts`, `kassuData.ts`)

## Component Structure Reorganization

To improve organization and maintainability, we've restructured the components directory:

### 1. Created a Logical Directory Structure

- [x] Created a `ui` directory for generic UI components
  - Moved AnimatedSkillBar, AnimatedText, TeamMemberCard components here
  - Moved TestimonialCard and other reusable UI components here
- [x] Created a `layout` directory for layout-specific components
  - Moved AboutErrorBoundary component here
- [x] Expanded the `sections` directory to include all section components
  - Moved AboutStory and AboutTeam components here
  - Organized sections by category (core, Juuso, Kassu)

### 2. Updated Imports and Exports

- [x] Created index.ts files for each directory to enable cleaner imports
- [x] Updated import paths in all affected components
- [x] Configured the main components/index.ts to re-export from subdirectories

This restructuring provides several benefits:
- Better separation of concerns
- More intuitive organization of components
- Easier discovery of components by function
- Simpler imports with fewer path segments
