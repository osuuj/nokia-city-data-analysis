# ADR 002: Error Handling Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application was experiencing inconsistent error handling, with some components displaying errors directly, others using custom error components, and many not handling errors at all. This led to a poor user experience and made debugging difficult.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive error handling strategy that includes:

1. **Error Boundaries**: React Error Boundaries to catch and handle JavaScript errors in the component tree.
2. **Consistent Error UI**: A standardized error message component for displaying errors to users.
3. **Error Logging**: A centralized error logging utility to capture and report errors.
4. **Error Recovery**: Mechanisms for users to recover from errors, such as retry buttons.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved User Experience**: Users will see consistent, helpful error messages.
- **Better Debugging**: Errors will be properly logged with context information.
- **Graceful Degradation**: The application will continue to function even when parts of it fail.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Error handling code will be centralized and consistent.

### Negative

- **Increased Bundle Size**: Error boundaries and error handling utilities add to the bundle size.
- **Development Overhead**: Developers need to be aware of and use the error handling utilities.
- **Potential Performance Impact**: Error boundaries can have a small performance impact.

## Implementation

### Error Boundaries

We will use React Error Boundaries to catch JavaScript errors in the component tree:

```typescript
class DashboardErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  // Implementation details
}
```

### Error Message Component

We will create a standardized error message component:

```typescript
const DashboardErrorMessage: React.FC<DashboardErrorMessageProps> = ({
  title,
  message,
  onRetry,
  // Other props
}) => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

### Error Logging Utility

We will implement a centralized error logging utility:

```typescript
function logError(error: Error, context: ErrorContext): void {
  // Implementation details
}
```

### Higher-Order Component

We will create a higher-order component to wrap components with error boundaries:

```typescript
function withDashboardErrorBoundary<P extends object>(
  Component: React.ComponentType<P>,
  options?: WithDashboardErrorBoundaryOptions
): React.FC<P> {
  // Implementation details
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Try-Catch Blocks

Using try-catch blocks throughout the codebase was considered but rejected due to the verbosity and the fact that they don't catch rendering errors.

### Third-Party Error Tracking Services

Using a third-party error tracking service like Sentry was considered but rejected due to the cost and the fact that we wanted more control over error handling.

### Global Error Handler

Using a global error handler was considered but rejected due to the fact that it doesn't provide component-level error recovery.
