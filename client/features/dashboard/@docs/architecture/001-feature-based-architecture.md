# ADR 001: Feature-Based Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application was initially structured using a traditional component-based architecture, with components organized by type (e.g., pages, components, hooks). As the application grew, this structure became increasingly difficult to maintain, with components becoming tightly coupled and difficult to test in isolation.

## Decision

We will adopt a feature-based architecture, where each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities. This approach will improve maintainability, testability, and scalability of the application.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved Maintainability**: Each feature is self-contained, making it easier to understand and modify.
- **Better Testability**: Features can be tested in isolation, reducing the need for complex test setups.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing ones.
- **Clearer Boundaries**: Feature boundaries are clearly defined, reducing the risk of tight coupling.
- **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand the codebase more quickly by focusing on one feature at a time.

### Negative

- **Potential Duplication**: Some utilities and components might be duplicated across features.
- **Initial Complexity**: The initial setup of the feature-based architecture requires more planning and organization.
- **Migration Effort**: Existing code needs to be refactored to fit the new architecture.

## Implementation

Each feature will follow a consistent structure:

```
feature/
  ├── components/       # UI components specific to the feature
  ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
  ├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
  ├── utils/            # Utility functions
  ├── data/             # Data fetching and API integration
  ├── store/            # State management (if needed)
  └── index.ts          # Public API for the feature
```

Features will communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, avoiding direct dependencies between features.

## Alternatives Considered

### Component-Based Architecture

The traditional component-based architecture was considered but rejected due to its limitations in scalability and maintainability.

### Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design was considered but rejected due to its complexity and the fact that our application is primarily UI-focused.

### Micro-Frontends

Micro-Frontends were considered but rejected due to the added complexity of managing multiple applications and the overhead of loading multiple JavaScript bundles.
