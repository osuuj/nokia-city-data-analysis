# Shared Folder Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This application is built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping

The shared folder contains resources that are shared across the application, following a feature-based architecture:
- `features/`: Feature-based organization of shared resources
  - `ui/`: Core UI components and design system
  - `data/`: Data visualization and management
  - `auth/`: Authentication and authorization
  - `forms/`: Form handling and validation
  - `api/`: API client and utilities
  - `error/`: Error handling and display
  - `loading/`: Loading state management
  - `theme/`: Theme management
  - `validation/`: Form and data validation
  - `notification/`: Notification management
  - `layout/`: Layout components and utilities

Each feature directory follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: React components
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `context/`: React context providers
