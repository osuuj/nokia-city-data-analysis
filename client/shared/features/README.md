# Feature-based Architecture

This directory follows a feature-based architecture where code is organized by feature rather than type. Each feature directory contains all related components, hooks, utilities, and types.

## Directory Structure

- `common/` - Shared components, hooks, and utilities used across multiple features
  - `components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `utils/` - Utility functions
  - `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

- `ui/` - Core UI components and design system
  - `components/` - Base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
  - `hooks/` - UI-specific hooks
  - `utils/` - UI utility functions
  - `types/` - UI-related type definitions

- `data/` - Data visualization and management
  - `components/` - Data visualization components
  - `hooks/` - Data-related hooks
  - `utils/` - Data processing utilities
  - `types/` - Data-related type definitions

- `forms/` - Form components and validation
  - `components/` - Form components
  - `hooks/` - Form-related hooks
  - `utils/` - Form validation utilities
  - `types/` - Form-related type definitions

- `layout/` - Layout components and structure
  - `components/` - Layout components
  - `hooks/` - Layout-related hooks
  - `utils/` - Layout utilities
  - `types/` - Layout-related type definitions

- `animations/` - Animation components and utilities
  - `components/` - Animation components
  - `hooks/` - Animation hooks
  - `utils/` - Animation utilities
  - `types/` - Animation-related type definitions

## Best Practices

1. Keep feature directories self-contained
2. Use index files to export public APIs
3. Maintain consistent file naming conventions
4. Document component props and hooks
5. Include tests for each feature
6. Use TypeScript for type safety
7. Follow the single responsibility principle
8. Implement proper error handling
9. Optimize for performance
10. Use composition over inheritance
