# Resources Feature Refactoring Progress

## Tech Stack and Architecture

This feature is part of a Next.js application built with:
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HeroUI**: For UI components and design system
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **FastAPI Backend**: For API endpoints and data fetching
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage
- **Mapbox**: For data visualization and mapping

The application follows a feature-based architecture where each feature is self-contained and follows a consistent structure:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for feature-specific logic
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Utility functions
- `data/`: Data fetching and API integration
- `store/`: State management (if needed)
- `docs/`: Documentation files

## Current Structure Analysis

The resources feature has a well-organized structure for managing and displaying resource content. The feature includes components for displaying resources in both card and accordion formats, with comprehensive type definitions and React Query integration for data management.

### Key Components:
- ResourceCard: Card component for displaying resource summaries
- ResourceAccordion: Accordion component for displaying resources by category
- VirtualizedResourceList: Efficiently renders large lists of resources using virtualization
- ResourceSkeleton: Provides loading states for resources
- ResourceErrorBoundary: Handles errors in the resource feature

### Data Management:
- Uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implements category-based resource organization
- Provides helper functions for resource filtering
- Reuses project feature's cache configuration
